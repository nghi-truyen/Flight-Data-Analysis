# Flight Data Analysis - Airbus FHS

We work on “Aircraft component reliability”, which is a vital contributing factor for dispatch reliability and aircraft system reliability. The main purpose of this project is to utilize the statistical models in order to predict if the parts of aircraft will be failure, and then to optimize the stock management.

We consider two services of Airbus, the airline and the FHS (Flight Hour Services). The Airbus planes are removed and installed the unserviceable and serviceable unit by their site stock. The Airbus FHS plays two important roles here is to provide serviceable units for the site stock and repair product for their customers (the OEMs).
