# Flight Data Analysis - Airbus FHS

We work on “Aircraft component reliability”, which is a vital contributing factor for dispatch reliability and aircraft system reliability. The main purpose of this project is to utilize the statistical models in order to predict if the parts of aircraft will be failure, and then to optimize the stock management.

We consider two services of Airbus, the airline and the FHS (Flight Hour Services). The Airbus planes are removed and installed the unserviceable and serviceable unit by their site stock. The Airbus FHS plays two important roles here is to provide serviceable units for the site stock and repair product for their customers (the OEMs).

The challenges is to:

    • reduce removals of parts,
    
    • reduce repair costs and,
    
    • reduce investments (stock optimization).
    
In the new situation due to the pandemic, the airline has less aircraft flying and more contracts ending. Consequently, they need to fine-tune their strategy “repair or stock unserviceable” to optimize the stock management. So the fact of forecasting for the failure of aircraft part is a significant underlying contributing factor for the proposals of such strategy.
